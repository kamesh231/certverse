Implemented Vercel Web Analytics integration for the certverse project.

## Summary
Successfully added Vercel Web Analytics to the Next.js application, enabling real-time performance monitoring and user analytics on Vercel deployments.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
1. **frontend/components/analytics-provider.tsx**
   - Added import for `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/next`
   - Integrated the Vercel Analytics component alongside existing Google Analytics
   - The component now always renders Vercel Analytics while conditionally rendering Google Analytics based on user consent
   - This ensures that Vercel Web Analytics tracks all visitors while respecting cookie consent preferences for Google Analytics

### Updated Dependencies:
1. **frontend/package.json**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics@^1.6.1` package
   - Updated `package-lock.json` with the new dependency and its sub-dependencies

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows Next.js best practices for the app directory structure:
- Used the `@vercel/analytics/next` export which provides a wrapper component optimized for Next.js with automatic route support
- The Analytics component is placed in the existing `AnalyticsProvider` component, which is already integrated in the root layout
- The component uses the `"use client"` directive as it's a client-side component
- Vercel Analytics is always enabled (no consent required as per Vercel's privacy standards)
- Google Analytics continues to work based on existing cookie consent preferences

## How It Works

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. The Vercel Analytics component automatically injects the tracking script
2. Data collection happens at `/_vercel/insights/*` routes
3. Metrics are available in the Vercel dashboard's Analytics tab
4. No additional configuration needed beyond package installation

## Testing

✓ Build completed successfully without errors
✓ Package installed and lockfile updated
✓ No breaking changes to existing functionality
✓ Existing analytics providers continue to work as before

## Next Steps

To enable data collection:
1. Ensure the project is deployed to Vercel
2. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Project Settings → Analytics → Enable)
3. Visit the application to start collecting data
4. View analytics in the Vercel dashboard's Analytics tab

After a few days of visitor traffic, you'll be able to view:
- Page views and visitor analytics
- Core Web Vitals metrics
- Route-specific performance data
- Custom events (available on Pro and Enterprise plans)
