Option C: Issue an adverse opinion in the audit report, recommending immediate shutdown of the financial application. → This option misses the audit objective or applies the wrong standard.

Proper documentation and escalation ensure that findings are recorded accurately and stakeholders can take corrective action within appropriate timeframes.  REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE: A large financial institution undergoes an audit of their payment processing system. The auditor identifies that critical reconciliation controls are manual and lack proper segregation of duties. Instead of just noting the issue, the auditor formally documents the finding, rates its severity (High - potential for fraud), and recommends implementation of automated controls with proper authorization workflows.
